The following processes are being scheduled using a preemptive, priority-based, round-robin scheduling algorithm.
Process Priority Burst Arrival 
P1 	 8 	 15 	  0
P2 	 2 	 20	  0
P3	 4 	 20	 20
P4  	 4 	 20 	 25
P5	 5	  5	 45
P6	 5 	 15 	 55
Each process is assigned a numerical priority, with a higher number indicating a higher relative priority. The scheduler will execute the highest priority process. For processes with the same priority, a round-robin scheduler will be used with a time quantum of 10 units. If a process is preempted by a higher-priority process, the preempted process is placed at the end of the queue.

ii. What is the turnaround time for each process?
iii. What is the waiting time for each process?
